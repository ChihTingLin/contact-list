Code 1 is better
Code 1 is using the event delegation event handling pattern.
Bind event listener on an ancestor element and the listener can capture events that are bubbled from its children elements.
The benefits are:
1. No need to setup many event listeners and therefore saves memory 
2. Less DOM modifications when UI is updating.
